##  What It's Not

- Graphing Library <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- SVG Library <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

note:
    - D3 is NOT a graphing library. If you want to just dump data at it and generate a handful of canned visualizations.   There's a handful of wrapper libraries out there for that.
    - It's also NOT a library for working with SVG elements. It can work with SVG. But it can also work with XML or HTML .
