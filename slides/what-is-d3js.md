    It provides tools for creating what are called Data Driven Documents (D3)

    This means, at it's core, D3 is about binding data to DOM elements.

    There are a handful of convenience methods for things like:
      - Loading data
      - Parsing data
      - Creating SVG Path Elements
      - Creating Scales
      - And more...
