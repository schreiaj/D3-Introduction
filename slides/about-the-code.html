<h2>About The Code</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mostly Snippets</li>
  <li>HTML - could use Handlebars/ERB/HAML</li>
  <li>Javascript - could use Coffeescript</li>
  <li>CSS - could use Jade/Sass/Stylus</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
    I've not written out all the HTML. It probably needs html and body tags. Maybe some css too. I do try to put all relevant code in but I preferred focusing on the D3 code not the boilerplate.
