    Selections are probably the hardest part of D3. Everything operates on them.

    At their core, they are an array of DOM Nodes. There's more to it than this, but for most purposes that description works.

    They allow you to set attributes of nodes in the selection. Can be values or functions.

    Allows binding of data to Nodes. More on this later.

    Selections may be 0 or more Nodes. Functions called will handle the case of an empty selection so don't worry.
